Project definition

Develepment of an web application that encourages the use of enviromentally friendly transportation.

It uses GPS information and multiple travel behaviours to calculate the difference between
the amount of greenhouse gases emmited from the chosen mode of transport and the usual
use of a car.Measures the distance and time that a user is travelling and uses a global avarage of
the emission that are/would be produced from the forms of transport.

The amount of greenhouse gases is measured in grams of CO2. This amount is then converted
into points (1:1), which are counted and are personal (each user has their own), so a
local or global ranking can be made as a form of competition between the users. Encouragement
can come in the form of virtual achievements or tockens that in case of practical application 
can be converted to real world value.

Some uses of the application can be a better distribution of the commuters during rush hours.
As the travel routes of the users can be made visible to other users, so that people can
make an informed decision when and how to travel to make tranportation more comfortable and
optimised.
