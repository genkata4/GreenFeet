Project contract:

Team (full names and roles)
- Unfortunately the team was disassembled and I am the only last member left
- Therefore, I represent all the roles of project manager, analytic, programmer, tester



Short description of the project

1. Problem that you aim to solve
- Main problem and aim is monitoring carbon emissions and footprints
- Transport sector contribues with over 27% but people are not informed
- There are many map applications that allows users to navigate and choose transport
- However, none of them provides information about greenhouse gas emissions produced by transportation

2. Proposed solution
- Map navigation app with CO2 information for each taken route plus a cumulative sum
- Web application with transport navigation
- Find and choose routes between any two locations
- Choose type of route and mean of transport
- Monitor your carbon footprint for each route
- Carbon emissions depend on mean of transport
- Connected to external navigation API



Commitments (Requirements that you commit to implement)
- Role of basic user with all capabilities

Extensions (Requirements that you might implement if time permits)
- Role of admin with all capabilities

Exclusions (Requirements that are not considered)
